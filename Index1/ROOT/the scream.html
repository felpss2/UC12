            <h1>The scream</h1>
            <h2>The Scream  a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893.
                The Norwegian name of the piece is Skrik (Scream), and the German title under
                which it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature).
                The agonized face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images in 
                art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition.
                Munch's work, including The Scream, had a formative influence
                on the Expressionist movement.[1]
                Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the
                setting sun's light turned the clouds "a blood red".
                He sensed an "infinite scream passing through nature". Scholars have located
                the spot to a fjord overlooking Oslo[2] and have suggested
                other explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of
                a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch 
                to his sister's commitment at a nearby lunatic asylum.</h2>
